Roles of domain layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain layer \ **implements business logic**\ to be provided to the application layer.

Implementation of domain layer is classified into the following.

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.30\linewidth}|p{0.60\linewidth}|
 .. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30 60

     - Classification
     - Description
   * - | 1.
     - | :ref:`domainlayer_entity`
     - | Creation of classes (Entity class) to hold business data.
   * - | 2.
     - | :ref:`repository-label`
     - | Implementation of the methods to operate on business data. These methods are provided to Service classes. 
       | These are in particular the CRUD operations on Entity object.
   * - | 3.
     - | :ref:`service-label`
     - | Implementation of the methods for executing business logic. These methods are provided to the application layer.
       | Business data required by the business logic is fetched as the Entity object through the Repository.

This guideline recommends the structure of creating Entity classes and Repository for the following reasons.

#. \ **By splitting the overall logic into business logic (Service) and the logic to access business data, the implementation scope of business logic gets limited to the implementation of business rules**\ , 
#. \ **Access logic to business data is standardized**\  by consolidating the operations of business data in the Repository. 

 .. note::

    Though this guideline recommends a structure to create Entity classes and Repository, it is not mandatory to perform development in this structure.

    Decide a structure by taking into account the characteristics of the application as well as the project (structure of development team and development methodology).

Flow of development of domain layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Flow of development of domain layer and allocation of roles is explained here.
| A case where application is created by multiple development teams is assumed; however, the flow itself remains same even if developed by a single team.

     - | Business application development team
     - | Business application development team takes charge of the implementation of Repository interface.

     - | Business application development team
     - | Business application development team develops Service interface and Service class using the Entity class and Repository provided by 
       | the common development team and the Repository implementation class created by the team itself.

 .. warning::

    A system having a large development scope is often developed by assigning the application to multiple teams.
    In that case, it is strongly recommended to provide a common team to design Entity classes and Repository.

    When there is no common team, O/R Mapper(MyBatis, etc.) should be called directly from Service and a method to
    access business data should be adopted without creating Entity classes and Repository .

Implementation of Entity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Policy of creating Entity class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Create an Entity using the following method.
| Specific creation method is shown in \ :ref:`domainlayer_entity_example`\ .

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.35\linewidth}|p{0.55\linewidth}|
 .. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 35 55

   * - Sr. No.
     - Method
     - Supplementary
   * - | 1.
     - | Create Entity class for each table.
     - | However, Entity class is not required for mapping tables which represent the relationship between the tables.
       | Further, when the tables are not normalized, Entity class for each table rule may not be applicable. Refer to the \ :ref:`Warning as well as Note outside this table <domainlayer_entity_policy_warning_note>`\  
       | for the approach related to not-normalized tables.
   * - | 2.
     - | When there is a FK (Foreign Key) in the table, the Entity class of FK destination table must be defined as one of the properties of this Entity.
     - | When there is 1:N relationship with FK destination table, use either \ ``java.util.List<E>``\  or \ ``java.util.Set<E>``\ .
       | The Entity corresponding to the FK destination table is called as the related Entity in this guideline.
   * - | 3.
     - | Treat the code related tables as \ ``java.lang.String``\  rather than as an Entity.
     - | Code related tables are to manage the pairs of code value and name.
       | When there is a need to bifurcate the process as per code values, ``enum`` class corresponding to code value should be created and it must be defined as property.

.. _domainlayer_entity_policy_warning_note:

 .. warning::

    When table is not normalized, **check whether to use the method of creating the Entity classes and Repository** by considering the following points.
    Since the unnormalized tables do not have good compatibility with JPA, it is better not to use JPA.

    * | Creating an appropriate Entity class may often not be possible because of increased difficulty in creating entities if the tables are not normalized.
      | In addition, efforts to create an Entity classes also increases.
      | Two viewpoints must be taken into consideration here. Firstly "Can we assign an engineer who can perform normalization properly?" and secondly "Is it worth taking efforts for creating normalized Entity classes?".
    * | If the tables are not normalized, the logic to fill the gap of differences between the Entity class and structure of table is required in data access.
      | Here the viewpoint to be considered is, "Is it worth taking efforts to fill the gap of differences between the Entity class and structure of table ?".

    The method of creating Entity classes and Repository is recommended; however, the characteristics of the application as well as the project (structure of 
    development team and development methodology) must also be taken into account.
    
.. _domainlayer_entity_policy_note:

 .. note::

    If you want to operate business data as application, and as normalized Entity even if the tables are not normalized,
    it is recommended to use MyBatis as an implementation of RepositoryImpl of the infrastructure layer.

    MyBatis is the O/R Mapper developed to map the SQL with object and not to map the database table record with object. 
    Therefore, mapping to the object independent of table structure is possible depending on the implementation of SQL, .

Entity structure
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
If Entity classes are created with the help of policy defined by the above table, it results into the following structure.

 .. figure:: images/service_entity_entity_layout.png
    :alt: Example of entity layout

      - | Entity class indicating 1 record of m_category table.
    * - | (6)
      - | ItemCategory
      - | Entity class is not created since m_item_category table is the mapping table to store the relationship between m_item table and m_category table.
    * - | (7)
      - | Coupon
      - | Entity class indicating 1 record of m_coupon table.
    * - | (8)
      - | OrderStatus
      - | Entity class is not created since c_order_status table is code table.


As it can be observed from the above entity diagram, it might first seem that Order class is the only main entity class
in the shopping site application; however, there are other main entity class as well other than Order class.

Below is the classification of main Entity classes as well as Entity class which are not main.

   * - | (1)
     - | Order class
     - | It is one of the most important Entity class in the shopping site.
       | Order class is the Entity indicating the order itself and a shopping site cannot be created without the Order class.
   * - | (2)
     - | Item class
     - | It is one of the most important Entity class in the shopping site.
       | Item class is the Entity indicating the products handled in the shopping site and a shopping site cannot be created without Item class.
   * - | (3)
     - | Category class
     - | Product categories are displayed usually on the top page or as a common menu in shopping sites. In such shopping sites, Category becomes a main entity.
         Usually operations like 'search category list' can be expected.
   * - | (4)
     - | Coupon class
     - | Often discounts through coupons are offered in the shopping sites as a measure of promoting sales of the products. 
       | In such shopping sites, Coupon becomes a main entity. Usually operations like 'search coupon list' can be expected.


The following are not main Entities for creating shopping site application.

   * - | (5)
     - | OrderItem class
     - | This class indicates 1 product purchased in 1 order and exists only as the related Entity of Order class.
       | So OrderItem class should not be considered as main Entity.
   * - | (6)
     - | OrderCoupon
     - | This class indicates 1 coupon used in 1 order and exists only as the related Entity of Order class.
       | So, OrderCoupon class should not be considered as main Entity.

Implementation of Repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roles of Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Repository has following 2 roles.

1. | **To provide to Service, the operations necessary to control Entity lifecycle (Repository interface).**
   | The operations for controlling Entity lifecycle are CRUD operations.

 .. figure:: images/repository_responsibility_1.png
    :alt: provide access operations to entity
    :width: 100%
    :align: center


2. | **To provide persistence logic for Entity (implementation class of Repository interface).**
   | Entity object should persist irrespective of the lifecycle (start and stop of server) of application.
   | Mostly relational database is the permanent destination of Entity. However, NoSQL database, cache server, external system and file (shared disk) can also be the permanent destination.
   | The actual persistence processing is done using O/R Mapper API.
   | This role is implemented in the RepositoryImpl of the infrastructure layer. Refer to \ :doc:`InfrastructureLayer`\  for details.

 .. figure:: images/repository_responsibility_2.png

    :align: center


Structure of Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Repository consists of Repository interface and RepositoryImpl and performs the following roles.

 .. figure:: images/repository_classes_responsibility.png
   :alt: persist entity
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.20\linewidth}|p{0.30\linewidth}|p{0.40\linewidth}|
 .. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 30 40

   * - Sr. No.
     - Class(Interface)
     - Role
     - Description

   * - | (1)
     - | Repository interface
     - | Defines methods to control Entity lifecycle required for implementing business logic (Service).
     - | Defines methods for CRUD operations of the Entity and is not dependent on persistence layer.
       | Repository interface belongs to the domain layer since it plays the roles of defining the operations on Entity required for implementing business logic (Service).

   * - | (2)
     - | RepositoryImpl
     - | Implements the methods defined in Repository interface.
     - | Implements CRUD operations of the Entity and is dependent on persistence layer. Performs actual CRUD processes using API that performs persistence provided by Spring Framework, O/R Mapper and middleware.
       | RepositoryImpl belongs to infrastructure layer since it plays the role of implementing the operations defined in Repository interface.
       | Refer to \ :doc:`InfrastructureLayer`\  for the implementation of RepositoryImpl.


| In case of multiple destinations in persistence layer, the resulting configuration as follows.
| due to this, the logic depending on persistence platform of Entity is hidden from business logic (Service).

 .. figure:: images/repository_not_depends_on.png
   :alt: persist entity
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

 .. note:: **Is it possible to hide 100% of persistence platform dependent logic from the Service class ?**

    In some cases it cannot be hidden completely due to constraints of persistence platform and the libraries used to access the platform.
    As much as possible, platform dependent logic should be implemented in RepositoryImpl instead of Service class.
    When it is difficult to exclude the platform dependent logic and merits of doing so are less,
    persistence platform dependent logic can be implemented as a part of business logic (Service) process.

    A specific example of this is given here. There are cases when unique constraints violation error is needed to be handled when save method
    of ``org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`` interface provided by Spring Data JPA is called.
    In case of JPA, there is a mechanism of cache entity operations and SQL is executed when transactions are committed.
    Therefore, since SQL is not executed even if save method of JpaRepository is called, unique constraints violation error cannot be handled in logic.
    There is a method (flush method) to reflect cached operations as means to explicitly issue SQLs in JPA.
    saveAndFlush and flush methods are also provided in JpaRepository for the same purpose.
    Therefore, when unique constraints violation error needs to be handled using JpaRepository of Spring Data JPA,
    JPA dependent method (saveAndFlush or flush) must be called.

 .. warning::

    The most important purpose of creating Repository is not to exclude the persistence platform dependent logic from business logic.
    The most important purpose is to limit the implementation scope of business logic (Service) to the implementation of business rules. 
    This is done by separating the operations to access business data in Repository. As an outcome of this, persistence platform dependent logic gets
    implemented in Repository instead of business logic (Service).


Creation of Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Repository must be created using the following policy only.

   * - Sr. No.
     - Method

   * - | 1.
     - | Create Repository for the main Entity only.
     - | This means separate Repository for operations of related Entity is not required.
       | However, there are case when it is better to provide Repository for the related Entity in specific applications (for example, 
       | application having high performance requirements etc).
   * - | 2.
     - | Place Repository interface and RepositoryImpl in the same package of domain layer.
     - | Repository interface belongs to domain layer and RepositoryImpl belongs to infrastructure layer. However,
       | Java package of RepositoryImpl can be same as the Repository interface of domain layer.
   * - | 3.
     - | Place DTO used in Repository in the same package as Repository interface.
     - | For example, DTO to store search criteria or summary DTO for that defines only a few items of Entity.

Implementation of Service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roles of Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Service plays the following 2 roles.

1. | **Provides business logic to Controller.**
   | Business logic consists of create, update, consistency check etc of business data as well as all the processes related to business logic.
   | Create and update process of business data should be delegated to Repository(or O/R Mapper) and \ **service should be limited to implementation of business rules.**\

 .. note:: **Regarding distribution of logic between Controller and Service**

    In this guideline, the logic to be implemented by Controller and Service should be as per the rules given below.

    1. For the data requested from the client, single item check and correlated item check is to be performed in Controller (Bean Validation or Spring Validator).

    2. Conversion processes (Bean conversion, Type conversion and Format conversion) for the data to be passed to Service, must be performed in Controller instead of Service.

    3. \ **Business rules should be implemented in Service.**\ Access to business data is to be delegated to Repository or O/R Mapper.

    4. Conversion processes (Type conversion and Format conversion) for the data received from Service (data to respond to the client), must be performed in Controller (View class etc).

    :alt: responsibility of logic
    :width: 90%
    :align: center


2. | **Declare transaction boundary.**
   | Declare transaction boundary when business logic is performing any operation which requires ensuring data consistency (mainly data update process).
   | Even in case of logic that just read the data, often there are cases where transaction management is required due to the nature of business requirements. In such cases, declare transaction boundary.
   | **Transaction boundary must be set in Service layer as a principle rule.** If it is found to be set in application layer (Web layer), there is a possibility that the extraction of business logic has 
   | not been performed correctly.

Structure of Service class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Service consists of Service classes and SharedService classes and plays the following role.
| In this guideline, POJO (Plain Old Java Object) having \ ``@Service``\  annotation is defined as Service or SharedService class. 
| We are not preventing the creation of interface and base classes that limit the signature of methods.

     - SharedService class
     - | \ **Provides shared (reusable) logic**\ for multiple Controllers and Service classes.
     - #. Methods of other SharedService classes can be called from a SharedService (Figure 2-1). However, **Calling hierarchy should not become complicated.** If calling hierarchy becomes complicated, there is a risk of reduction in maintainability.
       #. Methods of SharedService classes can be called from Controller (Figure 2-2). However, \ **it can be only be done if there is no problem from transaction management perspective.**\ If there is a problem from transaction management perspective, first create a method in Service class and implement transaction management in this method.
       #. \ **It is prohibited to call methods of Service class from SharedService (Figure 2-3).**\


| Dependency relationship of Service class and SharedService class is shown below.
| The numbers inside the diagram are related to the numbering in "Notes related to dependency relationship" column of the above table.

Reason for separating Service and SharedService
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| Logic that cannot be (should not be) reused and logic that can be (should be) reused exist in the business logic.
| To implement these 2 logics in the same class, it is difficult to decide whether a method can be re-used or not.
| To avoid this problem, \ **it is strongly recommended to implement the method to be re-used in the SharedService class**\ in this guideline.


Reason for prohibiting the calling of other Service classes from Service class
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| In this guideline, calling methods of other Service classes from a Service class is prohibited.
| Service provides business logic to a specific controller and is not created with the assumption of using it from other services.
| If it is called directly from other Service classes, the following situations can easily occur \ **and there is a risk of reduced maintainability.**\

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.90\linewidth}|
 .. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Sr. No.
     - Situations that can occur
   * - 1.
     - | The logic that must be implemented in the calling service class, gets implemented in the called service class for reasons like "having the logic at a single location" etc.
       | As a result, \ **arguments for identifying the caller, get added to the method easily; Ultimately, the logic is incorrectly abstracted out as shared logic (like utilities). It results into a modular structure without much insight.**\
   * - 2.
     - | If the stack patterns or stack of services calling each other is large in number, \ **understanding the impact of modifications in source-code due to change in specifications or bug fixes, becomes difficult.**\


Regarding interface and base classes to limit signature of method
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| In order to bring consistency in development of business logic, interfaces and base classes are created which limit the signature of the methods.
| The purpose is also to prevent the injection of differences due to development style of each developer by limiting the signature through interfaces and base classes.

 .. note::

    In large scale development, there are situations where not every single developer is highly skilled or situations like having consistency in development of business logic considering maintainability after servicing.
    In such situations, limiting the signature through interfaces can be an appropriate decision.
    
    In this guideline, we do not specifically recommended to create interface to limit signature; however, type of architecture must be selected on the basis of characteristics of the project.
    decide the type of architecture taking into account the project properties.

\

| Appendix has a sample of creating interface and base classes to limit the signature.
| Refer to \ :ref:`domainlayer_appendix_blogic`\  for details.

Patterns of creating service class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are mainly 3 patterns for creating Service.

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.15\linewidth}|p{0.25\linewidth}|p{0.50\linewidth}|
 .. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 25 50

   * - Sr. No.
     - Unit
     - Creation method
     - Description

   * - 1.
     - | For each Entity
     - | Create Service paired with the main Entity.
     - | Main Entity is in other words, business data. **If the application is to be designed and implemented with focus on business data, then Service classes should be created in this way.**
       |
       | If service is created in this way, business logic will also be created for each entity and it will become to extract shared logic.
       | However, if Service is created using this pattern, its affinity is not so good with the type of application which has to be developed 
       | by introducing a large number of developers at the same time. 
       | It can be said that the pattern is suitable when for the developing small or medium sized application.       
   * - 2.
     - | For each use-case
     - | Create Service paired with the use-case.
     - | **If the application is to be designed and implemented with focus on events on the screen, Service should be created in this way.**
       |
       | If the Service is created using this pattern, it is possible to assign a person to each use case; hence, its affinity is good with 
       | the type of application which has to be developed by introducing a large number of developer at the same time.
       | 
       | On the other hand, if Service is created using this pattern, shared logic within use case can be extracted to a single location; 
       | however, shared logic which spans across multiple use-case might not get extracted to a single location.
       | When it is very important to have extract shared logic out to a single location, it becomes necessary devise measures like having 
       | a separate team to look after designing shared components of business logic that span across multiple use cases. 
   * - 3.
     - | For each event
     - | Create Service paired with the events generated from screen.
     - | **If the application is to be designed and implemented with focus on events on the screen and BLogic class is auto-generated using TERASOLUNA ViSC, Service should be created in this way.** 
       | In this guideline, the Service class created using this pattern is called \ ``BLogic``\ .
       |
       | The characteristics of the application if creating Service using this pattern are basically same as those when creating Service for each use case.
       | 
       | However, in this case extracting shared logic out of business logic might get more difficult compared to creation of Service for each use-case (Pattern No. 2).
       | In this guideline, pattern of creating Service for each event is not specifically recommended. However, in large scale development, creating Service using this 
       | pattern can be considered as one of the options with the view of having consistency in development style of business logic from maintainability point of view.

 .. warning::

    **The pattern of Service creation must be decided by taking into account the features of application to be developed and the structure of development team.**

    **It is not necessary to narrow down to any one pattern** out of the 3 indicated patterns.
    Creating Services using different patterns randomly should be avoided for sure; however, **patterns can be used in combinations, if policy of usage of patterns in certain 
    specific conditions has been well-thought decision and has been directed by the architect.**
    For example, the following combinations are possible.

    [Example of usage of patterns in combination]

    * For the business logic very important to the whole application, create as SharedService class for each Entity.
    * For the business logic to be processed for the events from the screen, create as Service class for each Controller.
    * In the Service class for each controller, implement business logic by calling the sharedService as and when required.

 .. tip::

    BLogic is generated directly from design documents when using "TERASOLUNA ViSC".

Image of Application development - Creating Service for each Entity
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Following is the image of application development when creating a Service for each Entity.

 .. note::

    An example of a typical application in which a Service is created for each Entity is a REST application. REST application provides CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE of HTTP) 
    for published resources on HTTP. Most of the times, the resources published on HTTP are business data (Entity) or part of business data (Entity), they have good compatibility
    with the pattern of creating Service for each Entity.

    In case of REST application, most of the times, use-cases are also extracted on a "per Entity" basis. Hence, the structure is similar to the case when Service is created for on a "per use-case" basis.

Methods of creating Service class
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Below are the points to be taken care of while creating Service class.

- Creation of Service interface

 .. code-block:: java

    public interface CartService { // (1)
        // omitted
    }

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.90\linewidth}|

     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | **It is recommended to create Service interface.**
       | By providing an interface, it is possible to execute the method published as Service explicitly.

\

 .. note:: **Merits from architecture perspective**

    #. If interface is there, When using AOP, Dynamic proxies functionality of standard JDK is used.
       In case of no interface, CGLIB included in Spring Framework is used. In case of CGLIB there are certain restrictions like "Advice cannot be applied on final methods" etc.
       Refer to \ `Spring Reference Document -Aspect Oriented Programming with Spring(Proxying mechanisms)- <http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html#aop-proxying>`_\ for details.
    #. It becomes easier to create a stub of business logic. When application layer and domain layer are developed in parallel using different development teams, stubs of Service
       are required. When there is a need to create stubs, it is recommended to have interface .

- Creation of Service class

 .. code-block:: java

    @Service // (1)
    @Transactional // (2)
    public class CartServiceImpl implements CartService { // (3) (4)
        // omitted
    }

   * - | (1)
     - | **Add @Service annotation to class.**
       | By adding the above annotation, bean definition in configuration file is not required.
       | Specify package for component scanning in ``base-package`` attribute of <context:component-scan> element.
       | In case of this example, all the classes in "xxx.yyy.zzz.domain" is registered in container.
   * - | (2)
     - | **Add @Transactional annotation to class.**
       | By adding the above annotation, transaction boundary is set for to the all the methods of the Service class.
       | ``value`` attribute should be specified as required.
       | Refer to \ :ref:`transaction-management-declare-transaction-info-label`\  for details.

       | Moreover, to understand the points to be noted when using \ ``@Transactional``\  annotation, it is advisable to confirm with ":ref:`DomainLayerAppendixTransactionManagement`".
   * - | (3)
     - | **Consider interface name as XxxService and class name as XxxServiceImpl.**
       | Any naming conventions can be used. However, it is recommended to use distinguishable naming conventions for Service class and SharedService class.
   * - | (4)
     - | **Service class must not maintain state. Register it in container as bean of singleton scope .**
       | Objects (POJO such as Entity/DTO/VO) and values (primitive type, primitive wrapper class) where state changes in each thread should not be maintained in class level fields.
       | Setting scope to any value other than singleton (prototype, request, session)  using ``@Scope``  annotation is also prohibited.

\

 .. note:: **Reason for adding @Transactional annotation to class**

    Transaction boundary is required only for the business logic that updates the database. However, it is recommended to apply the annotation at class level to prevent bugs due to skipped annotation.
    However, defining \ ``@Transactional``\  annotation only at required places (methods which update the database) is also fine.

 .. note:: **Reason to prohibit non-singleton scopes**

    #. prototype, request, session are the scopes for registering bean that maintains state. Hence they must not be used in Service class.
    #. When scope is set to request or prototype, performance is affected as the bean generation frequency is high in DI container.
    #. When scope is set to request or session, it cannot be used in non Web applications (for example, Batch application).

 .. tip:: **Transaction definition of business logic for reference**

    When business logic for reference is to be implemented, by specifying \ ``@Transactional(readOnly = true)``\ ,
    instruction can be given to run the SQL under "Read-only transactions" for JDBC driver.

    The way of handling read-only transactions depends on the implementation of JDBC driver; hence, confirm the specifications of JDBC driver to be used.


 .. note:: **Points to be noted when using "Read-only transactions"**

    If it is set to "perform health check" when retrieving a connection from connection pool, "Read-only transactions" may not be enabled.
    For details on this event and to avoid the same, refer to :ref:`About cases where "Read-only transactions" are not enabled <DomainLayerTransactionManagementWarningDisableCase>`.

 .. note:: **Transaction definition when a new transaction is required to be started**

    Set \ ``@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)``\  to start a new transaction
    without participating in the transaction of the caller method.

.. _service-class-method-args-return-label:

Regarding arguments and return values of methods of Service class 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The below points must be considered for arguments and return values of methods of Service class.

| Serializable classes (class implementing \ ``java.io.Serializable``\ ) must be used for arguments and return values of Service class.
| Since there is possibility of Service class getting deployed as distributed application, it is recommended to allow only Serializable class.

**Typical arguments and return values of the methods are as follows.**

 * Primitive types (\ ``int``\ , \ ``long``\ )
 * Primitive wrapper classes (\ ``java.lang.Integer``\ , \ ``java.lang.Long``\ )
 * java standard classes (\ ``java.lang.String``\ , \ ``java.util.Date``\ )
 * Domain objects (Entity, DTO)
 * Input/output objects (DTO)
 * Collection (implementation class of \ ``java.util.Collection``\ ) of above types
 * void
 * etc ...

\

 .. note:: **Input/Output objects**

     #. Input object indicates the object that has all the input values required for executing Service method.
     #. Output object indicates the object that has all the execution results (output values) of Service method.

      If business logic(BLogic class) is generated using "TERASOLUNA ViSC" then, input and output objects are used as argument and return value of the of BLogic class.

**Values that are forbidden as arguments and return values are as follows.**

 * Objects (``javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest`` , ``javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse`` , ``javax.servlet.http.HttpSession`` , ``org.springframework.http.server.ServletServerHttpRequest``) which are dependent on implementation architecture of application layer (Servlet API or web layer API of Spring).
 * Model(Form, DTO) classes of application layer
 * Implementation classes of ``java.util.Map``

 .. note:: **Reason for prohibition**

    #. If objects depending on implementation architecture of application layer are allowed, then application layer and domain layer get tightly coupled.
    #. \ ``java.util.Map``\  is too generalized. Using it for method arguments and return values makes it difficult to understand what type of object is stored inside it. Further, since the values are managed using keys, the following problems may occur.

     * Values are mapped to a unique key and hence cannot be retrieved by specifying a key name which is different from the one specified at the time of inserting the value.
     * When key name has to be changed, it becomes difficult to determine the impacted area.


**How to sharing the same DTO between the application layer and domain layer is shown below.**

* DTO belonging to the package of domain layer can be used in application layer.

\

 .. warning::

   Form and DTO of application layer should not be used in domain layer.

| **It is recommended to create business exception class as subclass of java.lang.RuntimeException**.

\

 .. note:: **Reason for considering business exception as an unchecked exception**

   Since business exceptions need to be handled in controller class, they can be configured as checked exception.
   However in this guideline, it is recommended that business exception be subclass of unchecked exception (``java.lang.RuntimeException``). By default, 
   if there is a RuntimeException, transaction will be rolled back. Hence, doing this will prevent leaving a bug in the source-code due to inadequate settings of @Transactional annotation. 
   Obviously, if settings are changed such that transaction rollbacks even in case checked exceptions, business exception can be configured as subclass of checked exceptions.

Regarding transaction management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transaction management is required in the logic where data consistency must be ensured.

Method of transaction management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are various transaction management methods. However, in this guideline, \ **it is recommended to use "Declarative Transaction Management" provided by Spring Framework.**\

Declarative transaction management
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In "Declarative transaction management", the information required for transaction management can be declared by the following 2 methods.

* Declaration in XML(bean definition file).
* **Declaration using annotation (@Transactional) (Recommended).**

Refer to \ `Spring Reference Document -Transaction Management(Declarative transaction management)- <http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html#transaction-declarative>`_\  for
the details on "Declarative type transaction management" provided by Spring Framework.
\

 .. note:: **Reason for recommending annotation method**

    #. The transaction management to be performed can be understood by just looking at the source code.
    #. AOP settings for transaction management is not required if annotations are used and so XML becomes simple.

 .. warning:: **Default operations of rollback and commit when exception occurs**

    When rollbackFor and noRollbackFor is not specified, Spring Framework performs the following operations.

    * Commit when checked exception of (java.lang.Exception) class or its subclass occurs. \ **(Necessary to note)**\

 .. note:: **Regarding value attributes of @Transactional annotation**

    There is a value attribute in \ ``@Transactional``\  annotation. However, this attribute specifies which Transaction Manager to be used when multiple Transaction Managers are declared.
    It is not required to specify when there is only one Transaction Manager.
    When multiple Transaction Managers need to be used, refer to \ `Spring Reference Document -Transaction Management(Multiple Transaction Managers with @Transactional)- <http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html#tx-multiple-tx-mgrs-with-attransactional>`_\ .

    A mechanism is provided to run SQL under "Read-only transactions" by specifying \ ``readOnly = true``\ ; however,
    when all of the following conditions are satisfied, there will be a JDBC driver where "Read-only transactions" are not enabled.

    **[Conditions to generate this event]**

    * Perform health check when retrieving a connection from connection pool.
    * Disable 'Auto commit' of connection retrieved from connection pool.
    * Use \ ``DataSourceTransactionManager``\  or \ ``JpaTransactionManager``\  as \ ``PlatformTransactionManager``\ . (This event does not occur when using \ ``JtaTransactionManager``\ ).

    **[JDBC driver where occurrence of this event is confirmed]**

    * ``org.postgresql:postgresql:9.3-1102-jdbc41`` (JDBC 4.1 compatible JDBC driver for PostgreSQL 9.3)

    **[Method to avoid this event]**

    In a case where "Read-only transactions" are not enabled,
    if \ ``readOnly = true``\  is specified, it ends up carrying out the unnecessary processes.
    Therefore, it is recommended to execute the SQL under "Updatable transactions" even for the reference processes.

    Other methods to avoid this event are as follows:

    * Do not perform health check when retrieving a connection from connection pool.
    * Enable 'Auto commit' of the connection retrieved from connection pool. (Disable 'Auto commit' only when transaction management is required)

    However, However, do not change the design for 'health check' and 'auto commit' to avoid this event.

    **[Remarks]**

    * Reproduction of this event is confirmed on PostgreSQL 9.3 and Oracle 12c. It is not performed on any other database and versions.
    * In PostgreSQL 9.3, \ ``SQLException``\  occurs when \ ``java.sql.Connection#setReadOnly(boolean)``\  method is called.
    * When SQL or API call of JDBC is logged in using \ :ref:`log4jdbc <DataAccessCommonDataSourceDebug>`\ , \ ``SQLException``\  occurred from JDBC driver is output to log with ERROR level.
    * **SQL Exception occurred from JDBC driver is ignored by exception handling of Spring Framework. Hence, even though it is not an error as application behavior, the "Read-only transactions" is not enabled.**
    * Occurrence of this event is not confirmed in Oracle 12c.

    **[Reference]**

    When following log is output using \ :ref:`log4jdbc <DataAccessCommonDataSourceDebug>`\ , it will be treated as a case corresponding to this event.

  When propagation method of transaction is set to "REQUIRED", though there is only one physical transaction, internally Spring Framework creates transaction boundaries.
  In case of above example, when a method of SharedService is called, a TransactionInterceptor is started which internally provides transaction control boundary at SharedService level.
  Therefore, when an exception (which is set as target of rollback) occurs in \ ``SharedService``\  method, status of transaction is set to rollback (rollback-only) by \ ``TransactionInterceptor``\ .
  This transaction now cannot be committed.
  Going further, if the Service method tries to commit this transaction due to conflicting settings of rollback target exception between Service method and SharedShared method,
  \ ``UnexpectedRollbackException``\  is generated by Spring Framework notifying that there is inconsistency in transaction control settings. When UnexpectedRollbackException is generated, it should be checked that there is no inconsistency in rollbackFor and noRollbackFor settings.

| **Transaction management flow when propagation method of transaction is set to "REQUIRES_NEW"**
| When propagation method of transaction is set to "REQUIRES_NEW", a part of the sequence of processing (Processing done in SharedService) are processed in another transaction when called from Controller.

#. Controller calls a method of Service class. This method is under transaction control. At this time, since started transaction does not exist, transaction is started by ``TransactionInterceptor`` (Hereafter, the started transaction is referred as "Transaction A").
#. ``TransactionInterceptor`` calls the method of service class after transaction (Transaction A) is started.
#. Service class calls a method of ``SharedService`` class. At this time, though started transaction (Transaction A) exists, since propagation method of transaction is "REQUIRES_NEW", new transaction is started by \ ``TransactionInterceptor``\. (Hereafter, started transaction is referred as "Transaction B"). At this time, "Transaction A" is interrupted and the status changes to 'Awaiting to resume'.
#. \ ``TransactionInterceptor``\  calls the method of SharedService class after Transaction B is started.
#. \ ``TransactionInterceptor``\  performs commit or rollback according to the process result and ends the Transaction B.
   At this time, "Transaction A" is resumed and status is changed to Active.
#. \ ``TransactionInterceptor``\  performs commit or rollback according to the process result and ends the Transaction A.

Way of calling the method which is under transaction control
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| Since "Declarative transaction management" provided by Spring Framework is implemented using AOP, transaction management is applied only for method calls for which AOP is enabled.
| Since the default mode of AOP is **"proxy" mode, transaction control will be applied only when public method is called from another class.**\
| Note that \ **transaction control is not applied if the target method is called from an internal method even if the target method is a public method**\.

 .. note:: **In order to bring internal method calls under transaction control**

   It is possible to enable transaction control for internal method calls as well by setting the AOP mode to \ ``"aspectj"``\ .
   However, if internal method call of transaction management is enabled, the route of transaction management may become complicated;
   hence it is recommended to use the default "proxy" for AOP mode.

Settings for using transaction management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The settings required for using transaction management are explained.

PlatformTransactionManager settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

| In order to have transaction management done, it is necessary to define the bean of \ ``PlatformTransactionManager``\ .
| Spring Framework has provided  couple of classes based on the purpose; any class can be specified that meets the requirement of the application.

- :file:`xxx-env.xml`

 Example of settings for managing the transaction using JDBC connection which is fetched from DataSource is given below.

 .. code-block:: xml

     <!-- (1) -->
     <bean id="transactionManager"
           class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">

      - Description

    * - | (1)
      - | Specify the implementation class of PlatformTransactionManager.
        | It is recommended to set id as "transactionManager".

\

 .. note:: **When transaction management (Global transaction management) is required for multiple DBs (Multiple resources)**

     * It is necessary to use \ ``org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager``\  and manage transactions by using JTA functionality provided by application server.
     * When JTA is to be used in WebSphere and Oracle WebLogic Server, a \ ``JtaTransactionManager``\  which is extended for the application server is automatically set
       by specifying <tx:jta-transaction-manager/>.

        | When it is necessary to execute the operations with multiple resources in a single transaction, it is necessary to  use JTA for managing transactions.

Settings for enabling @Transactional
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

| In this guideline, it is recommended to manage transaction by using "Declarative transaction management" where \ ``@Transactional``\  annotation is used.
| Here, the settings required for using \ ``@Transactional``\  annotation are explained.

Regarding drawbacks of transaction management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| There is a description regarding "Understanding drawbacks of transaction" in IBM DeveloperWorks.
| Read this article about pitfalls of transaction management and pitfalls while using @Transactional of Spring Framework.
  Refer to \ `Article on IBM DeveloperWorks <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ts1/index.html>`_\ for details.

.. note::

    Since the article of IBM DeveloperWorks is an old article (year 2009), some of the content is different than the behavior when using Spring Framework 4.1.

    Specifically, the contents of "Listing 7. Using read-only with REQUIRED propagation mode - JPA".

    From Spring Framework 4.1, when Hibernate ORM 4.2 or higher version is used as JPA provider,
    it has been improved so that instruction can be given to run the SQL under "Read-only transactions" for JDBC driver (\ `SPR-8959 <https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8959>`_\ ).

    The way of handling read-only transactions depends on the implementation of JDBC driver; hence, confirm the specifications of JDBC driver to be used.


Programmatic transaction management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this guideline, "Declarative transaction management" is recommended. However, programmatic transaction management is also possible.
Refer to \ `Spring Reference Document -Transaction Management(Programmatic transaction management)- <http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html#transaction-programmatic>`_\  for details.

Sample of implementation of interface and base classes to limit signature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Interface to limit signature

Tips
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _tips_business_error-label:

Method of dealing with violation of business rules as field error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| When it is necessary to output the error of business rules for each field, the mechanism of (Bean Validation or Spring Validator) on the Controller side should be used.
| In this case, It is recommended to implement check logic as Service class and then to call the method of Service class from Bean Validation or Spring Validator.
| Refer to \ :doc:`../ArchitectureInDetail/Validation`\  business logic approach for details.
