Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Two main functionalities namely, "Authentication" and "Authorization" are provided by Spring Security
| for the security of applications.
| Authentication functionality identifies a user and thus prevents unauthorized access through spoofing.
| Authorization functionality controls the access to system resources
| according to the authority of the authenticated (logged-in) user.
| Moreover, it has functionality for assigning HTTP headers.

| Spring Security overview is shown in diagram below.

   **Picture - Spring Security Overview**

| Spring Security implements authorization and authentication processes
| with help of a group of ServletFilters that interact across several levels.
| Further, it also provides password hashing functionality, JSP authorized tag library etc.

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Authentication is the action that checks validity of a request. When connecting to the network or server, 
| through combination of user name and password, it further verifies whether the user has the required authority and
| also whether the person to be authenticated is really the user himself.
| For the details on how to use authentication in Spring Security, refer to \ :doc:`Authentication`\ .

Password hashing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| In password hashing, the original password is replaced with a hash value that is derived from the plaintext password using hash function.
| For the details on how to use it in Spring Security, refer \ :doc:`PasswordHashing`\ .

Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Authorization is the functionality to verify whether the authenticated user is allowed to use the resource that he is trying to access,
| using access control process.
| For details on how to use authorization in Spring Security, refer to \ :doc:`Authorization`\ .

How to use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Following settings need to be defined for using Spring Security.

pom.xml settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| To use Spring Security, following dependency needs to be added to pom.xml.

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.terasoluna.gfw</groupId>
        <artifactId>terasoluna-gfw-security-core</artifactId>  <!-- (1) -->
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.terasoluna.gfw</groupId>
        <artifactId>terasoluna-gfw-security-web</artifactId>  <!-- (2) -->
    </dependency>

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.90\linewidth}|
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | terasoluna-gfw-security-core is not web dependent. As a result, when using from a domain layer project,
       | only terasoluna-gfw-security-core should be added to dependency.
   * - | (2)
     - | terasoluna-gfw-web provides web related functionalities. It is dependent on terasoluna-gfw-security-core as well. Hence,
       | for Web projects, only terasoluna-gfw-security-web should be added to dependency.

Web.xml settings

     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | In addition to applicationContext.xml, add the Spring Security configuration file to 
       | the class path in contextConfigLocation. In this guideline, it is "spring-security.xml" file.
   * - | (2)
     - | filter-name should be defined as the Bean name to be used internally in Spring Security, namely, "springSecurityFilterChain".

     - Spring Security filter settings to enable various functionalities.
   * - | (4)
     - Enable the settings for all requests.

spring-security.xml settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| spring-security.xml is placed under the path specified in web.xml.
| Normally, it is set in src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/spring-security.xml.
| Please refer subsequent chapters for detailed explanation, as the following example is just a template.

.. _SpringSecurityAppendixSecHeaders:

Settings to assign a secure HTTP header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As shown below, security related headers can be set automatically in HTTP response by setting \ ``<sec:headers>``\  element in \ ``<sec:http>``\  of spring-security.xml.
By assigning these HTTP response headers, Web browser can detect an attack and deal with it.
This setting is not mandatory; however, it is recommended for strengthening security.

.. code-block:: xml

    <sec:http use-expressions="true">
      <!-- omitted -->
      <sec:headers />
      <!-- omitted -->
    </sec:http>

In this setting, HTTP response headers related to following fields are set.

* Cache-Control
* X-Content-Type-Options
* Strict-Transport-Security
* X-Frame-Options
* X-XSS-Protection

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.2\linewidth}|p{0.5\linewidth}||p{0.3\linewidth}|
.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50 30

   * - HTTP header name
     - Issues due to inappropriate settings (also includes cases where settings are not performed).
     - Behavior in case of appropriate settings
   * - | \ ``Cache-Control``\ 
     - | In some cases, the contents that can be viewed by a logged-in user are cached and can also be viewed by another user, after the first user logs out.
     - | Instruct such that the contents are not cached and ensure that the browser always fetches server information.
   * - | \ ``X-Content-Type-Options``\ 
     - | In some cases, browser determines operation contents just by checking the content details without using Content-Type. This may result in execution of unexpected scripts.
     - | Ensure that the browser does not determine the operation contents just by checking the content details without using Content-Type. Restrict script execution if the MIME type does not match.
   * - | \ ``Strict-Transport-Security``\ 
     - | In spite of expecting access to a secure page by HTTPS, there is a possibility of HTTP-origin attack when the page is accessed using HTTP (Example: Man-In-The-Middle-Attack (MITM) intercepts a user's HTTP request and redirects it to a malicious site.)
     - | Once a legitimate web site is accessed using HTTPS, the browser automatically uses only HTTPS, thereby preventing the Man In The Middle Attack such as being redirected to a malicious site.
   * - | \ ``X-Frame-Options``\ 
     - | If screen of malicious Web site A is made unavailable for viewing and instead a legitimate site B is embedded using \ ``<iframe>``\  tag, the user who thinks that he has accessed site B, is made to access site A, by the attacker.
       | In this condition, if 'Send' button of site A and link position of site B overlap, the attacker can make the user send a malicious request through site A, while the user thinks that the link of legitimate site B was clicked. (\ `Clickjacking <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking>`_\ )
     - | Ensure that the self-created Website (= site B) cannot be read in another Web site (= site A) using \ ``<iframe>``\  tag.
   * - | \ ``X-XSS-Protection``\ 
     - | Determination of harmful script by XSS filter implemented in browser, is invalidated.
     - | On realizing that the script is harmful, the XSS filter implemented in browser asks the user whether to execute it, or it is invalidated (behavior differs depending on browser).



The settings mentioned above can be performed individually as shown below in steps (1) to (5). Select them as and when required.
