     - Operation Overview
   * - | (1)
     - | Double clicking of 'Update' button
     - | Repeatedly clicking the button to perform update process.
   * - | (2)
     - | Reloading of screen after completing the update process
     - | Using the 'Refresh' button of the browser to reload the screen after completion of update process.
   * - | (3)
     - | Invalid screen transition using 'Back' button of the browser
     - | Using 'Back' button of the browser to go back to the previous page from update process completion screen and clicking the button again to perform update process.

Each problem is described in detail below.

Double clicking of 'Update' button
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| The following problems occur when the button to perform update process is clicked repeatedly.
| The example of "Product Purchase" on a shopping site is given below to explain the problems that are likely to occur if the necessary measures are not taken.

    In the above case, since buyer accidentally clicks 'Order' button again, **it results in duplicate purchase of same product.**
    Although the problem can be attributed to erroneous operation by the buyer, it is desirable to have the application design such that the above problems do not occur.

Reloading of screen after completion of update process
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| The following problems occur when the screen is reloaded after completion of update process.

Invalid screen transition using 'Back' button of the browser
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| The following problems occur if invalid screen transition is performed using 'Back' button of the browser.
| The example of "Product Purchase" on a shopping site is given below to explain the problems that are likely to occur if the necessary measures are not taken.

However, if update process gets executed even after performing invalid screen operations, the following problems occur.

 .. figure:: ./images/duplicate-allow-malicious-request.png
    :alt: duplicate allow a malicious request

 .. warning::

    As described above, update process getting executed even after performing invalid screen operations increases the risk of direct updates by a malicious attacker bypassing a valid route.

             - Description
           * - | (1)
             - | Attacker executes request for processing a direct product purchase without going through a valid screen transition.
           * - | (2)
             - | Server cannot detect that the request is getting executed through an invalid route; hence it updates DB based on the purchase of the product received through that request.

    Execution of purchase process through an invalid request increases the load on each server resulting in inability to purchase products through a valid route.
    As a result, the problem causes a ripple effect for the users who purchase the products through valid routes. Hence, it is desirable to have the application design such that the above problems do not occur.

Solutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The following measures should be taken to resolve the problems described above.
| In view of malicious operations such as tampering with requests, **(3) "Applying transaction token check" is mandatory.**

   * - Sr. No.
     - Solution
     - Overview
   * - | (1)
     - | Preventing double clicking of a button using JavaScript
     - | When a button to perform update process is clicked, the button control using JavaScript prevents the submission of a request if the button is clicked again.
   * - | (2)
     - | Applying PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern
     - | A redirect command is returned as a response to the request for performing update process (request by POST method) and then a screen for transition is returned as a response of GET method which is automatically requested from a browser.
       | When a PRG pattern is used, the request generated while reloading the page after the screen is displayed is a GET method; hence re-execution of update process can be prevented.
   * - | (3)
     - | Applying transaction token check
     - | Issue a token value for each screen transition and compare the token value sent from browser with the token value stored on the Server to make sure that invalid screen operations do not occur in the transaction.
       | Implementation of transaction token check can prevent re-execution of update process after the page is reloaded using 'Back' button of the browser.
       | Deleting the token value stored on the Server after performing the token check can prevent double submission as a Server side process.

 .. note::

    When only transaction token check is performed, even a simple operational mistake can lead to transaction token error which in turn results in a low-usability application for the user.
    
    To ensure usability as well as to prevent the problems that occur due to double submission, measures such as "Preventing double clicking of a button using JavaScript" and "Applying PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern" are necessary.
    
    ** Although this guideline recommends that you implement all the measures, the decision should be taken depending on application requirements.**

 .. Warning::

   In Ajax and Web services, since it is difficult to transfer transaction tokens which change for each request, transaction token check need not be used.
   In Ajax, double submit protection should be performed using only one of the above measures i.e. "Preventing double clicking of a button using JavaScript".

 .. todo::
 
    **TBD**

    There is further scope for reviewing the check methods in Ajax and Web services.


Preventing double clicking of a button using JavaScript
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

| Prevent double clicking of buttons like button to perform update process or button which is used to perform time-consuming search process.
| When a button is clicked, use JavaScript to disable that button or link.
| Typical examples of control used for disabling a button or link are given below

#. By disabling the button or link so that it cannot be clicked
#. By maintaining a flag for tracking process status and displaying notification "Process in progress" when the button or link is clicked in the middle of the process.



The image when a button is disabled will be as follows:

 .. figure:: ./images/prevent-double-click.png
   :alt: prevent double click
   :width: 60%

 .. warning::
 
    If all the buttons and links on the screen are disabled, the screen operations can no longer be performed if there is no response from the Server.
    Therefore, it is recommended not to disable buttons or links that execute events such as "Return to previous screen" or "Go to top screen" etc.

About PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

| A redirect command is returned as a response to the request for performing update process (request by POST method) and then a screen for transition is returned as a response of GET method which is automatically requested from a browser.
| When a PRG pattern is used, the request generated while reloading the page after the screen is displayed is a GET method; hence re-execution of update process can be prevented.

       | The request called by Reload functionality displays "Purchase Complete" screen of the product; hence **update process is not re-executed.**
   * - | (7)
     - | Server sends response with a "Purchase Complete" screen.

 .. note::
 
    It is recommended to use \ :abbr:`PRG (Post-Redirect-Get)`\  pattern for the processes associated with update process and implement a control so that a request of GET method is sent when 'Refresh' button of the browser is clicked.

 .. warning::
 
    In the \ :abbr:`PRG (Post-Redirect-Get)`\  pattern, the re-execution of update process cannot be prevented by clicking 'Back' button of the browser on Completion screen.
    A transaction token check must be performed to prevent re-execution of update process after an invalid screen transition using 'Back' button of the browser.
    
.. _double-submit_transactiontokencheck:

Transaction Token Check
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Transaction token check consists of the following 3 processes.

* When a request is received from Client, the Server stores a value (hereafter referred to as transaction token) for uniquely identifying a transaction on the Server.
* Server passes the transaction token to the Client. In case of a Web application with screens, it passes the transaction token to the Client using hidden tag of form.
* When submitting the next request, Client sends the transaction token that was passed from the Server. Server compares the transaction token received from the Client and the transaction token stored on the Server.

When the transaction token sent in the request does not match with the transaction token stored on the Server, it is treated as invalid request and an error is returned.

 .. warning::
 
    Misuse of transaction token check leads to poor usability of the application; hence the scope of its usage should be defined by considering the following points.

    * | It is not necessary to include reference-type requests that do not involve data update and requests that perform only screen transitions in the scope of transaction token check.
      | If the scope of transactions is extended unnecessarily, transaction token errors are more likely to occur which in turn reduces the usability of the application.
    * | Transaction token check is not mandatory for the processes wherein there is no problem even if the data gets updated multiple times from business perspective (user information update etc.).
    * | Transaction token check is mandatory for the processes such as deposit process or product purchase process etc. wherein there is a risk of duplicate execution.

|

The process flow when expected operations are performed and process flow when unexpected operations are performed using transaction token check are shown below.

 .. figure:: ./images/transaction-token-check-overview.png
   :alt: transaction token overview
   :width: 100%

| The process flow when expected operations are performed is as follows:

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.90\linewidth}|
 .. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | Client sends the request.
   * - | (2)
     - | Server creates the transaction token (token001) and stores it on the Server.
   * - | (3)
     - | Server passes the created transaction token (token001) to the Client.
   * - | (4)
     - | Client sends the request along with the transaction token (token001).
   * - | (5)
     - | Server checks whether the transaction token (token001) stored on the Server and the transaction token (token001) submitted by the Client are same.
       | **Since the values are same, the request is considered as valid.**
   * - | (6)
     - | Server generates transaction token (token002) to be used in the next request and updates the value stored on the Server.
       | At this point, the transaction token (token001) is discarded.
   * - | (7)
     - | Server passes the updated transaction token (token002) to the Client.

| The process flow when unexpected operations are performed is as follows:
| Here, 'Back' button of the browser is taken as an example; however, this is also applicable for the direct requests from shortcuts etc.

 .. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.90\linewidth}|
 .. list-table::

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (8)
     - | 'Back' button of the browser on Client side is clicked.
   * - | (9)
     - | Request is sent from Client side along with the transaction token (token001) of the screen which is displayed after clicking 'Back' button.
   * - | (10)
     - | Server checks whether the transaction token (token002) stored on the Server and the transaction token (token001) submitted by the Client are same.
       | **Since the values are different, the request is considered as invalid and a transaction token error is thrown.**
   * - | (11)
     - | Server sends response with an error screen to notify that a transaction token error has occurred.

|

The 3 events described below can be prevented by transaction token check.

* Invalid screen transition in case of a business process that requires fixed screen transition
* Data update due to invalid requests that do not involve valid screen transitions
* Duplicate execution of update process due to double submission

|

Invalid screen transition in case of a business process that requires fixed screen transition, can be prevented by the flow shown below.

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | Buyer clicks 'Order' button on "Product Purchase" screen.
       | Since the transaction token stored on the Server and the transaction token submitted by the Client match, the process to purchase the product is executed.
       | **At this time, the value of the transaction token stored on the Server is discarded and updated to a new token value.**
   * - | (2)
     - | Server updates DB based on the purchase of the product received through request (1).
   * - | (3)
     - | Server sends response with a "Purchase Complete" screen for the product received through request (1).
   * - | (4)
     - | Buyer uses 'Back' button of the browser to go back to "Product Purchase" screen.
   * - | (5)
     - | Buyer again clicks 'Order' button on "Product Purchase" screen which is displayed using 'Back' button of the browser.
       | **Since the transaction token sent by the Client is a value which has already been discarded, a transaction token error occurs.**
   * - | (6)
     - | Server sends response with an error screen to notify that a transaction token error has occurred.

|

Data updated by an invalid request which does not involve a valid screen transition can be prevented by the flow shown below.

 .. figure:: ./images/transaction-token-check-prevent-malicious-request.png

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | Attacker sends a request to purchase the product directly without performing a valid screen transition.
       | **Since the request for generating a transaction token is not executed, a transaction token error occurs.**
   * - | (2)
     - | Server sends response with an error screen to notify that a transaction token error has occurred.

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | Buyer clicks 'Order' button on "Product Purchase" screen.
       | Since the transaction token stored on the server and the transaction token submitted by the Client match, the process to purchase the product is executed.
       | **At this time, the value of the transaction token that is stored on the server is discarded and updated to a new token value.**
   * - | (2)
     - | Buyer accidentally clicks 'Order' button again before the response of (1) is returned.
       | **Since the transaction token sent by the Client is a value which has already been discarded, a transaction token error occurs** when process of (1) is executed.
   * - | (3)
     - | Server **sends response with an error screen to notify that a transaction token error has occurred** for the request (2).
   * - | (4)
     - | Server updates DB based on the purchase of the product received through request (1).
   * - | (5)
     - | Server attempts to respond with a "Purchase Complete" screen for the product received  through request (1); however since the stream for responding to the request of (1) is closed due to the transmission of the request of (2), it fails to send response with a "Purchase Complete" screen.

 .. warning::
 
    This can prevent duplicate execution of update process at the time of double submission; however this does not resolve the problem of server not being able to respond with a screen to notify the completion of process.
    Therefore, it is also recommended to deal with this problem by preventing double clicking of a button using JavaScript.

About NameSpace of transaction token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the transaction token check functionality provided by the common library, it is possible to set a NameSpace in the container for storing transaction token.
This enables parallel execution of update process using a tab browser or multiple windows.

Problems that occur when there is no NameSpace
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| Let us see the problems that occur when there is no NameSpace.
| The figure below illustrates an example wherein two clients are arranged side by side; basically 2 windows are launched on same machine. 

 .. figure:: ./images/token-only-one.png

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | The request is sent from Window 1, then the transaction token (token001) received as a response is stored in the browser.
       | The transaction token stored on the server is considered token001.
   * - | (2)
     - | The request is sent from Window 2, then the transaction token (token002) received as a response is stored in the browser.
       | **The transaction token stored on the server is considered token002. The transaction token (token001) generated by the process (1) is discarded at this point.**
   * - | (3)
     - | The request is sent from Window 1 along with the transaction token (token001) stored in the browser.
       | Since the transaction token stored on the server (token002) and the transaction token sent by the request (token001) do not match, the request is considered as invalid resulting in a transaction token error.

 .. warning::
 
    **The update process cannot be executed concurrently in absence of NameSpace; hence the application becomes a low-usability application.**

|

Behavior when NameSpace is specified
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
| Let us now see the behavior when NameSpace is specified.
| The problem wherein the update process could not be executed concurrently in the absence of NameSpace can now be resolved by specifying a NameSpace.
| The figure below illustrates an example wherein two clients are arranged side by side; basically 2 windows are launched on same machine. 

 .. figure:: ./images/token-namespace.png
   :alt: token namespace
   :width: 100%

| NameSpaces are shown as 111, 222 in the figure.
| ** When a NameSpace is specified, the transaction token in the NameSpace allocated to the transaction is handled independently. Hence, it does not affect the transactions of another NameSpace.**
| Here, even though the browser is explained using different Windows, the tab browser works in the same way. For generated keys and usage method, refer to \ :ref:`doubleSubmit_how_to_use_transaction_token_check`\ .

Preventing double clicking of button using JavaScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Double clicking of a button on Client side can be prevented using JavaScript.
| Once a button is clicked, it should not be possible to click it again till it is re-generated.

    The check method in JavaScript will be described in detail in subsequent versions.

Using PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The example of implementing PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern is given below.
| The application which involves a simple screen transition such as Input Screen-> Confirmation Screen-> Completion Screen is taken as an example.

Using transaction token check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The example of implementation using transaction token check is given below.
| Transaction token check functionality is provided by the common library and not by Spring MVC.

Transaction token check provided by common library
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Transaction token check functionality of common library provides \ ``@org.terasoluna.gfw.web.token.transaction.TransactionTokenCheck``\  annotation to perform the following tasks:

* Creation of NameSpace for transaction token
* Starting the transaction
* Token value check in the transaction
* Ending the transaction



The transaction token check can be performed declaratively by assigning \ ``@TransactionTokenCheck``\  annotation for the
Controller class and the handler methods of the Controller class.

       * By setting a NameSpace, it is possible to prevent the requests belonging to different Namespaces from interfering with each other and it is also possible to increase the number of screen transitions that can operate in parallel.
       * The value specified in the "value" attribute of \ ``@TransactionTokenCheck``\  annotation is used as the value to be used for NameSpace.
       * When both "value" attribute of the "class" annotation and "value" attribute of the "method" annotation are specified, the value which concatenates both the values with \ ``"/"``\  is used as NameSpace. When the same value is specified in multiple methods, the methods belong to same NameSpace.
       * When the "value" attribute is specified only in "class" annotation, all the NameSpaces of the transaction tokens generated in that class will be the value specified in "class" annotation.

       * | A maximum limit exists for the number of multiple TokenKeys which can be concurrently stored and the default number is 10. The count of stored TokenKeys is managed for each NameSpace.
       * | When the number of TokenKeys stored for each NameSpace reaches the maximum value at the time of \ ``TransactionTokenType.BEGIN``\ , a new transaction will be stored as a valid transaction by discarding the TokenKey with the oldest date and time of execution (Least Recently Used (LRU)).
       * | When the access is made by using the discarded transaction token, a transaction token error is thrown.
   * - | (3)
     - TokenValue
     - * TokenValue is an element for storing the token value of the transaction.
       * TokenValue is generated upon execution of the method wherein \ ``TransactionTokenType.BEGIN``\  or \ ``TransactionTokenType.IN``\  is declared in the "type" attribute of \ ``@TransactionTokenCheck``\  annotation.

 .. warning::
 
    When the "value" attribute is specified only in "method" annotation and if the same value is specified in another Controller, it should be noted that it will be handled as a request for carrying out a series of screen transitions.
    "value" attribute should be specified by this method only when the screen transitions across Controllers are to be treated as the same transaction.
    
    Basically, it is recommended not to use the method wherein "value" attribute is specified only in "method" annotation.

 .. note::
 
    The method for specifying NameSpace is classified according to creation granularity of the Controller,
    
    * when "value" attributes of both "class" annotation and "method" annotation are specified
    * when "value" attribute is specified only in "class" annotation
    
    
    
    1. | When a handler method which corresponds to multiple usecases is to be implemented in Controller, "value" attributes of both "class" annotation and "method" annotation are specified.
       | For example, this pattern is used when registration, change, deletion of users is to be implemented in a single Controller.
    2. | When a handler method which corresponds to a single usecase is to be implemented in Controller, "value" attribute is specified only in "class" annotation.

     - | When \ ``<form:form>``\  tag is used in JSP and if BEGIN or IN is specified in "type" attribute of \ ``@TransactionTokenCheck``\  annotation, the Value of \ ``name="_TRANSACTION_TOKEN"``\  is automatically embedded as a hidden tag.
   * - | (2)
     - | When \ ``<form>``\  tag of HTML is used, a hidden tag same as (1) is embedded using \ ``<t:transaction />``.
   * - | (3)
     - | When \ ``<form>``\  tag of HTML is used, csrf token necessary for CSRF token check provided by Spring Security needs to be embedded as a hidden item.
       | For csrf token necessary for CSRF token check, refer to  \ :ref:`csrf_formtag-use`\ .

 .. note::
    
    If \ ``<form:form>``\  tag is used, the parameters necessary for CSRF token check are also automatically embedded. Refer to \ :ref:`csrf_htmlformtag-use`\  for the parameters necessary for CSRF token check.

 .. note::
    
    \ ``<t:transaction />``\  is a JSP tag library provided by the common library.
    For the "t:" used in (2), refer to  \ :ref:`view_jsp_include-label`\ .

* Example of Output HTML

Following observations can be made upon verifying the output HTML.

* | For NameSpace, the value specified in "value" attribute of the class annotation is set.
  | In the above example, \ ``"transactionTokenCheckExample"``\  (underlined in orange) is the NameSpace.
* | For TokenKey, the value that was issued at the start of the transaction is circulated and set.
  | In the above example, \ ``"c0123252d531d7baf730cd49fe0422ef"``\  (underlined in blue) is the TokenKey.
* | Value to be set for TokenValue varies depending on request.
  | In the above example, \ ``"3f610684e1cb546a13b79b9df30a7523"``\ , \ ``"da770ed81dbca9a694b232e84247a13b"``\ ,
  | \ ``"bd5a2d88ec446b27c06f6d4f486d4428"``\  (underlined in green) are TokenValues.

.. _usecase_of_transaction_token_type_CHECK:

When a process which does not update screen for file downloading process is included in the use case
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
For the use cases which include process wherein screen is not returned to the client during file downloading process,
when the TransactionTokenType is not configured appropriately, care must be taken since the transaction token error is likely to occur even during normal operations.

An example wherein the transaction token error occurs during a normal operation due to specification of inappropriate TransactionTokenType is shown below.

   * - | (3)
     - | Server delivers the token thus created (token001) to the client.
   * - | (4)
     - | Client sends a file downloading request including the token (token001).
   * - | (5)
     - | Server checks whether the token retained on the server (token001) and the token sent by the client (token001) are identical.
       | **Since the value is same, the request is determined as a legitimate request.**
   * - | (6)
     - | Since \ ``IN``\  is configured in \ ``TransactionTokenType``\, server generates a token (token002) to be used in the next request and updates the value which is retained on the server.
       | At this point, the token (token001) is discarded.
   * - | (7)
     - | Server returns the requested file.
       | **Since the updated token is not returned to the client, token on the screen (token001) and token of the server (token002) do not match at this point.**

       | **Since the value is not the same, the request is determined as an illegitimate request.**


As shown above, when the transaction token is applied for the transition from screen wherein file downloading process is performed (screen2) to next screen (screen3),
token mismatch occurs during normal operation if \ ``IN``\  is used in \ ``TransactionTokenType``\  of file downloading process.
For these cases, \ ``CHECK``\  is used in the \ ``TransactionTokenType``\.

.. warning::

   A method wherein \ ``@TransactionTokenCheck``\  is not assigned to file downloading method of \ ``Controller``\  can also be used as a method wherein the token on the server is not updated.
   However, the method should be selected considering that when the \ ``@TransactionTokenCheck``\  is not assigned, the token is not returned
   to the client.
   
   For example, if a method wherein \ ``@TransactionTokenCheck``\  is not assigned is selected when either the screen or file are likely to be returned during the process results
   such as displaying an error message on the screen when a reexecutable error occurs during file downloading process,
   the token of the screen when the error message is returned to the screen is lost and
   the transaction token error occurs as a result during a normal operation.

Exclusion control of parallel processing while using a session
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When a form object is stored in a session using \ ``@SessionAttributes``\  annotation,
and if multiple screen transitions of the same processing are performed in parallel, screen operations may interfere with each other and the values displayed on the screen and the values stored in the session may no longer match.

Transaction token check function can be used to prevent requests from non-conforming screens as the invalid requests.

The maximum limit of transaction tokens that can be stored for each NameSpace is set to 1.

.. _double-submit_disable-cache:

Transaction Token Check in case that the cache of browser is disabled
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the cache of web browser is disabled due to \ ``Cache-Control``\  in HTTP response header,
the message will display which tells the cache has been expired before transaction token error
in case of the illegal operation flow in "\ :ref:`double-submit_transactiontokencheck`\ "

Concretely, the following screen will display when the browser back button is clicked (8).
This is an example of Internet Explorer 11.

 .. figure:: ./images_DoubleSubmitProtection/page-expired.png

There is no problem because the double submit itself is prevented.

In \ :doc:`blank projects <../../ImplementationAtEachLayer/CreateWebApplicationProject>`\  after 5.0.0.RELEASE,
it is configured so that the cache is disabled by \ :ref:`Spring Security <SpringSecurityLinkageWithBrowser>`\ .

If showing the transaction error screen is preferred instead of the screen above,
excluding \ ``<sec:cache-control />``\  is required.
However, \ ``<sec:cache-control />``\  should be configured from the point of view of security.

Following observations can be made upon verifying the output HTML.

* | For NameSpace, a fixed value called \ ``"globalToken"``\  is set.
* | For TokenKey, the value that was issued while starting the transaction is circulated and set.
  | In the above example, \ ``"9d937be4adc2f5dd2032292d153f1133"``\  (underlined in blue) is the TokenKey.
* | Value to be set for TokenValue varies depending on request.
  | In the above example, \ ``"9204d7705ce7a17f16ca6cec24cfd88b"``\ , \ ``"69c809fefcad541dbd00bd1983af2148"``\ ,
  | \ ``"6b83f33b365f1270ee1c1b263f046719"``\  (underlined in green) are TokenValues.



The behavior when the maximum limit of transaction tokens for each NameSpace is set to 1 and global token is used, is explained below.

   * - Sr. No.
     - Description
   * - | (1)
     - | In window 1 process, TransactionTokenType.BEGIN is performed and global token is generated.
   * - | (2)
     - | In window 2 process, the token is updated by TransactionTokenType.BEGIN.
       | Although internally the data is reshuffled rather than getting updated, it gives the impression that the token has been updated since one transaction token can be stored on the server.
   * - | (3)
     - | Token value is checked in TransactionTokenType.IN of window 1 process.
       | \ **Transaction token generated in process 1 is submitted as request parameter; however since the specified token does not exist on the server, a transaction token error occurs.**\ 
   * - | (4)
     - | Token value is checked in TransactionTokenType.IN of window 2 process.
       | The transaction token generated in process 2 is submitted as request parameter and it is checked whether the value matches with the token value stored on the server.
       | If the value matches, the process is continued.

     - | When a screen is to be displayed using redirect, hidden tag for transaction token does not exist.

 .. note::
 
    The transaction token existing on the server is automatically deleted when a new global token is generated.


Quick Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


| The table below illustrates an example of a business application for managing Account and Customer. It shows the required settings for transaction tokens and business limitations.
| The usecases assumed in this business application are Create, Update, Delete relating to Account and Customer.
| By using the table below as reference, the maximum limit of tokens and NameSpace settings should be performed as per the system requirements.
