Spring Security is a framework which is used while implementing the security countermeasure function in the application. 
Spring Security can also be used in stand-alone application, but generally it is used while implementing the security countermeasures for Web application deployed in servlet container.
This chapter describes only those functions provided by Spring Security which are considered to be frequently used in general Web application.

.. tip:: **Functions not introduced in the guideline**

    Spring Security also provides many functions not introduced in this guideline.
    Refer \ `Spring Security Reference <http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.1.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#security-filter-chain>`_\  to know all functions provided by Spring Security.

.. note:: **Spring Security version**

    This guideline assumes the use of Spring Security 4.0 or higher version.
    Various changes have been applied for upgrading version of Spring Security to 4.0 and the samples described later also have used Spring Security 4.

    Refer \ `Migrating from Spring Security 3.x to 4.x (XML Configuration) <http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/migrate/current/3-to-4/html5/migrate-3-to-4-xml.html>`_\  for the changes.

.. _SpringSecurityArchitecture:

Spring Security architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview of Spring Security architecture and the role of key components those configure Spring Security are described before explaining each function in detail.

.. note::

    The developers need not be directly aware of the contents described over here while using the default operation provided by Spring Security as it is or
    while using the mechanism to support the configuration of Spring Security.
    Therefore, this section can be skipped while reading when the user first wants to know how to use each function.
    
    However, since the contents described here are required while customizing the default operation of Spring Security,
    it is recommended that the application architect should go through it once.

.. _SpringSecurityProcess:

Framework processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spring Security has adopted the architecture that implements security countermeasures for Web application using the servlet filter mechanism and executes the processes in the following flow.

.. figure:: ./images_SpringSecurity/Architecture.png
    :width: 100%

    **Spring Security Framework architecture**

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.90\linewidth}|
.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 90

    * - Sr. No.
      - Description
    * - \ (1)
      - Client sends a request to the Web application.
    * - \ (2)
      - \ ``FilterChainProxy``\  class (servlet filter) of Spring Security receives the request,
        calls method of \ ``HttpFirewall``\  interface and incorporates the firewall function for \ ``HttpServletRequest``\  and \ ``HttpServletResponse``\ .
    * - \ (3)
      - \ ``FilterChainProxy``\  class assigns process to Security Filter (servlet filter) class for security countermeasures provided by Spring Security.
    * - \ (4)
      - Security Filter consists of multiple classes and subsequent servlet filter is called if servlet filter process is successfully completed.
    * - \ (5)
      - When the last Security Filter process is successfully completed, subsequent process (like servlet filter or servlet) is called and the resources in the Web application are accessed.
    * - \ (6)
      - \ ``FilterChainProxy``\  class sends response of resources returned by the Web application to the client.

|

The key component that configures the framework process for the Web application is as follows.
For details, refer \ `Spring Security Reference -The Security Filter Chain- <http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.1.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#security-filter-chain>`_\ .


FilterChainProxy
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

\ ``FilterChainProxy``\  class is a servlet filter class that is an entry point of the framework process for the Web application.
This class controls the entire flow of the framework process and assigns specific security countermeasure process to Security Filter.

HttpFirewall
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

\ ``HttpFirewall``\  interface incorporates the firewall function for \ ``HttpServletRequest``\  and \ ``HttpServletResponse``\ .
By default, \ ``DefaultHttpFirewall``\  class is used and the checks for Directory traversal attack and HTTP response splitting attack are implemented.

SecurityFilterChain
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

\ ``SecurityFilterChain``\  interface manages Security Filter list to be applied to the request received by \ ``FilterChainProxy``\ .
By default, \ ``DefaultSecurityFilterChain``\  class is used and the Security Filter list to be applied is managed for each pattern of request URL.

For example, security countermeasures for the details those vary according to the URL can be applied if the bean is defined as follows.

* Definition example of xxx-web/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/spring-security.xml

.. code-block:: xml

    <sec:http pattern="/api/**">
        <!-- ... -->
    </sec:http>

    <sec:http pattern="/ui/**">
        <!-- ... -->
    </sec:http>

Security Filter
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Security Filter class is a servlet filter class that provides a process required to implement framework function and security countermeasure function.

Spring Security is a mechanism to implement the security countermeasures for the Web application by linking multiple Security Filters.
Here, core class required to implement authentication and authorization functions is introduced.
For details, refer \ `Spring Security Reference -Core Security Filters- <http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.1.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#core-web-filters>`_\ .

    * - Class name
      - Description
    * - \ ``SecurityContextPersistenceFilter``\
      - A class that provides a process to share the authentication information across the requests.
        Authentication information is shared across the requests by storing it in \ ``HttpSession``\ , in the default implementation.
    * - \ ``UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter``\
      - A class that performs the authentication process using user name and password specified in the request parameter.
        It is used at the time of form authentication.
    * - \ ``LogoutFilter``\
      - A class that performs logout process.
    * - \ ``FilterSecurityInterceptor``\
      - A class to execute authorization process for HTTP request (\ ``HttpServletRequest``\ ).
    * - \ ``ExceptionTranslationFilter``\
      - A class that handles the exception occurred in \ ``FilterSecurityInterceptor``\  and controls response returned to the client.
        It returns response that prompts authentication in case of access by unauthenticated user and 
        response that notifies authorization error in case of access by authenticated user in the default implementation.

.. _SpringSecuritySetup:


Spring Security setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A setup method to apply Spring Security to the Web application is explained.

Here, the simplest method of setup that applies Spring Security to the Web application and displays the default login screen provided by Spring Security is explained.
Customization method and extension method required in real application development are described sequentially in the following sections.

.. note::

    When the development project is created from \ `Blank project <https://github.com/terasolunaorg/terasoluna-gfw-web-multi-blank>`_\  , the setting described here is already configured.
    For how to create a development project, refer ':doc:`../ImplementationAtEachLayer/CreateWebApplicationProject`' .

.. _SpringSecuritySetupDependency:

Applying dependent library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, the common library that uses Spring Security as dependency is applied.
Refer :ref:`frameworkstack_common_library` for the relation between Spring Security and common library.

This guideline assumes that the development project is created using Maven.

* Setup example of xxx-domain/pom.xml

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.terasoluna.gfw</groupId>
        <artifactId>terasoluna-gfw-security-core</artifactId>  <!-- (1) -->
    </dependency>
